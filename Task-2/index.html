        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Gautham, a passionate software developer based in Bangalore. With a strong background in computer science and a keen interest in web development, I have honed my skills in building dynamic and responsive web applications. My journey into programming started in high school when I first encountered the world of coding through C and Java. Since then, my curiosity and love for technology have driven me to constantly learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.</p>
        <p>I hold a degree in Computer Science from [Your University], where I developed a solid foundation in software engineering principles, algorithms, and data structures. During my studies, I worked on several projects that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, further fueling my enthusiasm for software development.</p>
        <p>In my professional career, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects, ranging from small business websites to large-scale web applications. My expertise lies in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end technologies such as Python and Node.js.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, participating in coding competitions, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with like-minded individuals to create innovative solutions.</p>
